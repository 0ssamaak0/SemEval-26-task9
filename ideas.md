# Ideas
- Use AlDi to visualize train data ✅
- ARBERT: MSA & MARBERT: Dialects (Merging?)
- DSPY
- Adapters? 
- Aux task learning e.g., Sentiment?

- Gated Hierarchical Multi-Task Learning (GH-MTL): explicitly models the logical dependencies between subtasks. (DeBERTa-v3 for English and MARBERTv2 for Arabic), integrated via late-fusion ensembling.
- we advocate for the application of Asymmetric Loss (ASL) and Supervised Contrastive Learning (SCL), alongside SetFit (Sentence Transformer Fine-tuning)
- Model Ensemble

# Qs
- Model Size Limitations
- External & Synthetic Data? Reannoation etc.
<!-- - Can I participate in the competition using only 1 or 2 languages? -->

# TODOs
- Use ACL Tempelate
